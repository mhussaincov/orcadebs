hi there,
this is just a repo with orca screen reader dev packages 

built from upstream i.e from gitlab in .deb format.
checkinstall was used to build the .deb archives.

built for amd64 based machines sorry 32 bit users!

warning!
when you install the .deb,
it will override your current "stable" version of orca with this development version!
you have been warned!
all it lieves me to say is enjoy!
